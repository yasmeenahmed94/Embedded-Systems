This method doesn’t require a dedicated
peripheral for the ICU, it uses a normal timer
and a external interrupt peripheral with the
following algorithm:

• Apply the PWM signal to be measure on the EXTI pin while
configuring the EXTI mode to be rising edge detection.
• At the first rising edge, an interrupt would be generated,
inside the ISR do the following:
 Enable the timer to start count.
 Configure the EXTI to detect falling edge
• With the falling edge, another interrupt would be generated,
inside the ISR do the following:
 Read the value of the timer and save it in a variable called Ton
 Reset the timer to count from 0 again
 Configure the EXTI to detect rising edge
• With the next rising edge, and interrupt would be generated, inside the ISR do the
following:
 Read the value of the timer and save it in a variable called Toff
